Notation
========

This page summarizes the notation conventions used in the **OpenSTREAM** documentation. The theory pages, solver descriptions, closure model documentation, and implementation notes are kept consistent across the mixture, two-fluid, three-field, and four-field formulations.

General conventions
-------------------

OpenSTREAM uses one-dimensional, cross-section averaged conservation equations. Unless otherwise stated, the independent variables are time and the axial coordinate:

.. math::

   t \quad \text{and} \quad z

where :math:`t` is time and :math:`z` is the axial coordinate along the flow channel.

The following conventions are used throughout the documentation:

* :math:`z` for the axial coordinate.
* :math:`t` for time.
* :math:`k` as a generic field or phase index when no specific constituent is intended.
* Subscripts identify phases, fields, interfaces, and walls.
* Superscripts identify time levels, iteration counters, or model-specific states when needed.
* All symbols are defined immediately after the equation in which they first appear.

Phase and field subscripts
--------------------------

The notation distinguishes between thermodynamic phases and computational fields. A phase is a physical state of matter, such as liquid or vapor. A field is a computationally resolved constituent with its own transported variables.
