.. dropdown:: What is OpenSTREAM?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   **OpenSTREAM**, short for *Open Solvers for Two-phase flow Research,
   Engineering Analysis and Modeling*, is an open-source, object-oriented
   MATLAB environment for simulating one-dimensional, multi-field,
   liquid-vapor two-phase flows with phase change in straight channels.

   OpenSTREAM includes four solver frameworks:

   * a mixture solver with thermal non-equilibrium capabilities;
   * a two-fluid solver that represents the liquid and vapor phases
     separately;
   * a three-field solver for annular two-phase flow;
   * a four-field solver that separates the liquid film into base-film and
     disturbance-wave fields.

   Depending on the selected solver and closure models, OpenSTREAM can
   represent wall boiling, interfacial evaporation and condensation, and
   the associated exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy between phases
   and fields.

   The solver frameworks provide different levels of physical detail and
   support education, model development, performance evaluation, and
   validation.

.. dropdown:: Why should I use OpenSTREAM instead of another available code?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM is not intended as a replacement for established
   thermal-hydraulic codes. It is designed primarily as an open, transparent,
   and extensible environment for education, fundamental model development,
   closure-model implementation, controlled numerical experiments, and
   validation of one-dimensional two-phase flow formulations.

   OpenSTREAM may be particularly useful when you need:

   * **Full access to the source code.** The governing equations, closure
     models, numerical algorithms, input processing, and post-processing
     methods can be inspected and modified directly.

   * **A transparent modeling environment.** Primary variables, secondary
     quantities, source terms, field exchanges, and convergence histories
     are accessible through the MATLAB solver objects. This facilitates
     interpretation, debugging, and conservation checks.

   * **Several solver frameworks within a common architecture.** OpenSTREAM
     includes mixture, two-fluid, three-field, and four-field formulations.
     The same geometry, boundary conditions, fluid-property interface, and
     general workflow can therefore be used to compare different levels of
     physical resolution.

   * **State-of-the-art annular-flow modeling.** The three-field solver separates
     the liquid into wall-film and entrained-droplet fields. The four-field
     solver further separates the liquid film into base-film and
     disturbance-wave fields and includes wave-frequency transport.

   * **A practical platform for closure-model development.** Physical models
     are selected through documented input enumerations and implemented in
     dedicated phase or field classes. A developer can add, modify, test,
     and compare closure models without working within a large proprietary
     code base.

   * **Rapid prototyping in MATLAB.** MATLAB provides an interactive
     environment for inspecting objects, modifying equations, visualizing
     results, performing parameter studies, and developing new models.

   * **Reproducible research and education.** Input sets, tutorials,
     documentation, references, and source code can be distributed together,
     allowing users to inspect the assumptions behind a calculation and
     reproduce the workflow.

   * **A computationally efficient one-dimensional model.** OpenSTREAM is
     useful when cross-section-averaged axial behavior is sufficient and
     the computational expense and geometric detail of a multidimensional
     CFD calculation are not required.

   Other codes may be more appropriate when the application requires:

   * qualified or extensively validated models for a specific industrial
     application;
   * complete reactor-system or plant-network simulation;
   * closed-loop systems, including natural-circulation loops;
   * simultaneous solution of multiple connected flow paths and their flow
     distribution;
   * dedicated component models for pumps, valves, vessels, separators, or
     heat exchangers;
   * multidimensional flow resolution;
   * complex geometries, crossflow, or connected flow networks;
   * compressible pressure-wave dynamics;
   * multi-component fluids or non-condensable gases;
   * safety or licensing analysis.

   The appropriate code therefore depends on the purpose of the analysis.
   OpenSTREAM is especially well suited to understanding, developing, and
   evaluating models in a transparent one-dimensional framework. A more
   established application code may be preferable when a broad component
   library, an application-specific validation basis, or a qualified
   engineering workflow is required.

   Selecting OpenSTREAM does not remove the need for numerical verification,
   closure-model assessment, applicability review, and validation against
   appropriate reference data.

.. dropdown:: What is unique about OpenSTREAM, and what are its main strengths?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM combines advanced one-dimensional two-phase flow models with
   an open, modern, and extensible software architecture. Its purpose is not
   only to perform simulations, but also to make the governing equations,
   closure models, numerical methods, and calculated source terms accessible
   for inspection, modification, and collaborative development.

   Its main distinctive features and strengths include:

   * **Advanced models rarely available in open-source thermal-hydraulic
     codes.** To the best of the developers' knowledge, OpenSTREAM provides
     the only openly available implementations of its four-field annular-flow
     model and Mixture Relaxation Model within a general two-phase flow
     simulation environment.

     The four-field model explicitly represents vapor, entrained droplets,
     the base liquid film, and disturbance waves. It also includes transport
     of wave frequency, allowing the evolution of disturbance-wave behavior
     to be studied. The model therefore provides a level of annular-flow
     detail that is not commonly available in one-dimensional
     thermal-hydraulic codes.

     The Mixture Relaxation Model extends the conventional mixture
     formulation by solving additional vapor mass and energy conservation
     equations. It provides a computationally efficient framework for
     representing thermal non-equilibrium through relaxation of interfacial
     mass and energy transfer.

   * **Several solver frameworks within one consistent environment.**
     OpenSTREAM includes mixture, two-fluid, three-field, and four-field
     solvers. These frameworks share the same general input system,
     geometry definition, fluid-property interface, session management, and
     post-processing approach.

     This common structure allows users to compare different levels of
     physical resolution without moving between unrelated codes or
     reconstructing the complete simulation workflow.

   * **A modern object-oriented architecture.** OpenSTREAM is implemented
     using MATLAB classes that represent solvers, phases, fields, inputs,
     fluid properties, sessions, and plotting utilities. Shared behavior is
     organized through inheritance and common base classes, while
     solver-specific behavior is implemented in dedicated modules.

     This architecture supports modular development and helps isolate
     changes to a particular physical model, field, or solver. It also makes
     primary variables, secondary quantities, source terms, and solver
     methods directly accessible through the corresponding objects.

   * **Direct access to primary and secondary variables.** Users can inspect
     the primary solution variables, such as mass flow rate, pressure,
     velocity, and enthalpy, together with derived quantities such as void
     fraction, film thickness, interfacial area, flow regime, and
     disturbance-wave frequency, where applicable to the selected solver.

     The stored pseudo-time convergence histories also allow users to examine
     how the steady-state solution was obtained. This level of access is
     useful for interpretation, debugging, numerical diagnostics, and
     verification.

   * **Direct access to field exchange terms.** The mass, momentum, and
     energy exchange terms calculated by the selected solver are readily
     accessible through the corresponding phase and field objects.

     This includes wall and interfacial transfer terms, such as evaporation,
     condensation, entrainment, deposition, drag, shear, and heat transfer,
     where applicable to the selected solver. Access to the individual
     contributions facilitates interpretation of the governing equations,
     conservation checks, closure-model evaluation, and debugging.

   * **Direct access to pressure-drop contributions.** The individual
     pressure-drop components calculated by the mixture solver are readily
     available for inspection and post-processing.

     These contributions can be examined separately to determine the
     relative effects of gravity, wall friction, spatial acceleration,
     temporal acceleration, and local pressure losses, as applicable to the
     simulated case. This decomposition helps users understand the physical
     origin of the calculated pressure distribution.

   * **Integrated plotting and animation capabilities.** Each solver
     provides dedicated methods for visualizing its principal variables and
     calculated exchange terms. Axial distributions, time histories, and,
     where implemented, time-elevation distributions can be generated
     directly from the solver object.

     The plotting methods support solver-specific quantities, selected axial
     and time indices, multiple plot arrangements, and animation of transient
     results. This allows users to inspect a calculation interactively
     without first developing separate post-processing routines.

   * **Designed for model development and comparison.** Physical models are
     selected through documented input options and implemented in dedicated
     phase or field classes. New closure models can therefore be introduced,
     verified, and compared with existing models without modifying an
     opaque or monolithic code base.

     The shared solver architecture is particularly useful for studying how
     assumptions made at the mixture, phase, or field level influence the
     calculated results.

   * **Comprehensive and integrated documentation.** The OpenSTREAM
     documentation includes installation instructions, theory descriptions,
     governing equations, notation, a glossary, package and class
     references, tutorials, publications, contribution guidance, and this
     FAQ.

     Solver-specific MATLAB Live Scripts provide executable examples that
     users can inspect and modify. The documentation is generated from the
     same repository as the source code, helping to keep implementation
     details and user guidance together.

   * **Interactive MATLAB workflow.** MATLAB provides an environment in
     which users can run a case, inspect solver objects, modify models,
     visualize intermediate quantities, perform parameter studies, and
     develop post-processing routines interactively.

     MATLAB Live Scripts combine formatted explanations, executable code,
     figures, and calculated output in a single document, making them useful
     for education, demonstrations, and reproducible technical studies.

   * **Open and modifiable source code.** OpenSTREAM is distributed under
     the MIT License. Users can inspect, use, modify, and redistribute the
     code in accordance with the license terms.

     Open development enables independent scrutiny of the modeling basis and
     supports collaboration among researchers and institutions. The source
     code, documentation, input cases, and references can be considered
     together when evaluating a model.

   * **Computational efficiency.** The one-dimensional formulation and
     streamlined numerical methods provide a computationally efficient
     framework for steady-state and transient calculations.

     This efficiency facilitates rapid model development, repeated
     calculations, closure-model comparisons, parameter studies,
     sensitivity analyses, and validation exercises.

   These strengths do not mean that OpenSTREAM is more appropriate than
   other thermal-hydraulic codes. Established system, subchannel, and
   CFD codes may provide broader component libraries, more complex
   geometries, multidimensional resolution, or a more extensive validation
   basis for particular applications.

   OpenSTREAM is most distinctive when transparency, access to the governing
   models, advanced annular-flow modeling, thermal non-equilibrium model
   development, and controlled comparison of solver frameworks are central
   to the objective of the study.

.. dropdown:: What should I read first?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   A suggested learning path is:

   #. Follow the installation instructions in the Usage section.
   #. Run **Tutorial #1: OpenSTREAM Quick Start**.
   #. Continue with the solver-specific tutorial that matches your needs:

      * Tutorial #2 for the mixture solver;
      * Tutorial #3 for the two-fluid solver;
      * Tutorial #4 for the three-field solver;
      * Tutorial #5 for the four-field solver.

   #. Consult the theory pages for governing equations and assumptions.
   #. Use the package reference to inspect model options, object properties,
      and methods.

.. dropdown:: How do I make OpenSTREAM available in MATLAB?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Add the OpenSTREAM root folder to the MATLAB search path. For example,
   when running a tutorial from the ``tutorials`` folder:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      osp = './..';
      addpath(osp);

   If MATLAB cannot find a class such as ``InputSet`` or
   ``MixtureSolver``, verify that the OpenSTREAM root folder is correct and
   present on the MATLAB path.

   You can inspect the resolved location of a class with:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      which Inputs.InputSet
      which Solvers.Mixture.MixtureSolver

.. dropdown:: Why does OpenSTREAM require Python?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM uses the Python version of **CoolProp** to calculate fluid
   thermophysical properties. ``CoolPropWrapper`` provides the interface
   between MATLAB and Python.

   MATLAB must therefore use a compatible Python installation. Check the
   active Python environment with:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      pyenv

   You can test the property interface with:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      cp = CoolPropWrapper.CoolPropWrapper();

   If Python or CoolProp cannot be loaded, follow the MATLAB-Python
   compatibility and CoolPropWrapper setup instructions in the installation
   section.

.. dropdown:: Which MATLAB and Python versions should I use?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Use one of the MATLAB/Python combinations listed in the tested
   compatibility table. Other combinations may work but are not necessarily
   exercised by the continuous-integration workflow.

   When reproducing or reporting a result, record the MATLAB release with:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      version('-release')

   Also record the Python and CoolProp versions when fluid-property behavior
   is relevant.

.. dropdown:: Which CoolProp version should I install?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The CI-tested environment currently installs CoolProp==8.0.0 and
   nanobind. However, other CoolProp versions may work.

.. dropdown:: Where can I find working examples?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The ``tutorials`` folder contains MATLAB Live Scripts that can be run and
   modified directly. The documentation also provides completed HTML
   versions for reference.

   Start with **Tutorial #1: OpenSTREAM Quick Start**, then continue with
   the solver-specific tutorial that matches your application.

Running simulations
-------------------

.. dropdown:: What is the minimum workflow for running a case?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   A basic mixture-solver calculation consists of four steps:

   #. import the required packages;
   #. construct an ``InputSet``;
   #. construct the solver;
   #. call ``solve``.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      import Inputs.*
      import Solvers.*
      import Solvers.Mixture.*

      % Load the inputSet.
      inputSet = InputSet( ...
          modelFilePath          = './inputs/models.inp', ...
          modelID                = 'TUTORIAL1', ...
          optionsFilePath        = './inputs/options.inp', ...
          optionsID              = 'DEFAULT', ...
          geometryFilePath       = './inputs/geom.inp', ...
          geometryID             = 'TUTORIAL1', ...
          bcFilePath             = './inputs/tutorial1.inp', ...
          sessionParentDir       = fullfile(pwd,'outputs'), ...
          overwriteSessionFiles = true, ...
          LOGMODE                = 'BOTH');

      % Create and solve the three-field solver.
      mixSolver = MixtureSolver(inputSet);
      mixSolver.solve();

      % Generate defaults axial distribution plots
      mixSolver.plotz();

.. dropdown:: How are OpenSTREAM inputs organized?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   An OpenSTREAM case is assembled from four separate input categories.
   Each category is normally defined in a dedicated input file:

   * **Model inputs** select the physical models and closure models.

   * **Numerical options** control time steps, iteration limits, relaxation
     factors, and convergence criteria.

   * **Geometry inputs** define the channel length, cross-sectional flow
     area, wall perimeters, and orientation.

   * **Boundary conditions** define the system pressure, inlet enthalpy,
     inlet mass flow rate, total power, and axial power distribution.

   The paths to the four input files are provided separately when
   constructing an ``InputSet``, for example:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      inputSet = InputSet( ...
          modelFilePath    = './inputs/models.inp', ...
          modelID          = 'TUTORIAL1', ...
          optionsFilePath  = './inputs/options.inp', ...
          optionsID        = 'DEFAULT', ...
          geometryFilePath = './inputs/geom.inp', ...
          geometryID       = 'TUTORIAL1', ...
          bcFilePath       = './inputs/tutorial1.inp');

   The model, numerical-option, and geometry files may each contain several
   input sets. An identifier such as ``TUTORIAL1`` or ``DEFAULT`` selects
   the required set from the corresponding file.

   A boundary-condition file may contain the information required
   for a particular steady-state or transient case. Depending on how the
   study is organized, separate boundary-condition files can be used for
   different operating conditions or transients.

   This separation allows physical models, numerical options, geometries,
   and boundary conditions to be combined and reused without duplicating
   complete case definitions. For example, one geometry can be evaluated
   using several physical-model sets, or one physical-model set can be
   applied to several boundary-condition cases.

.. dropdown:: Can I specify inlet temperature instead of inlet enthalpy?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   No. The boundary-condition input interface requires the inlet specific
   enthalpy, ``HIN``, in J/kg. Direct specification of inlet temperature is
   not supported and is not currently planned.

   Specific enthalpy provides a more general definition of the inlet
   thermodynamic state. At a specified pressure, temperature can define a
   single-phase subcooled-liquid or superheated-vapor state, but it cannot
   uniquely define a saturated two-phase state. At saturation, the liquid,
   vapor, and all intermediate two-phase states have the same saturation
   temperature but different specific enthalpies.

   In contrast, inlet specific enthalpy can represent:

   * a subcooled-liquid inlet;
   * a saturated-liquid inlet;
   * a saturated two-phase inlet with a specified vapor quality;
   * a saturated-vapor inlet;
   * a superheated-vapor inlet.

   If the inlet condition is known as temperature and pressure for a
   single-phase state, first calculate the corresponding specific enthalpy
   for the selected fluid. Enter the resulting value as ``HIN`` in the
   boundary-condition file:

   .. code-block:: text

      PRESSURE    ! System pressure [Pa]           > ...
      HIN         ! Inlet specific enthalpy [J/kg] > ...

   For a saturated two-phase inlet, determine ``HIN`` from the system
   pressure and the required inlet vapor quality. A temperature-only input
   would not contain enough information to distinguish among saturated
   liquid, a two-phase mixture, and saturated vapor.

.. dropdown:: What input-file formats are supported?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM supports its native ``.inp`` format and the JSON format. The
   examples and tutorials generally use the native ``.inp`` format.

.. dropdown:: What happens if I do not specify a model or numerical option?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Unspecified entries use the default values defined by the corresponding
   input class, principally ``Inputs.Model`` and ``Inputs.Options``.

   Defaults make basic cases easier to configure, but they should not be
   treated as universally appropriate. For research or validation work,
   review and document all influential physical and numerical selections.

.. dropdown:: Why does MATLAB print many default-value warnings?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The warnings identify properties that were not explicitly specified and
   therefore use their class defaults.

   These messages are useful while developing or reviewing a case.
   Tutorials may temporarily suppress them to keep the displayed output
   concise:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      warning off
      inputSet = InputSet(...);
      warning on

   Do not suppress warnings routinely until the configuration has been
   reviewed. An unexpected warning can reveal an omitted or unsupported
   input.

.. dropdown:: Why does OpenSTREAM report that an input entry was not used?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Common causes include:

   * a misspelled keyword;
   * a keyword that does not belong to the selected input class;
   * an obsolete keyword;
   * an entry intended for another model configuration.

   Check the keyword against ``Inputs.Model``, ``Inputs.Options``,
   ``Inputs.Geometry``, ``Inputs.BoundaryConditions``, or the relevant
   package-reference page.

   An entry reported as unused is not applied to the corresponding input
   object. Whether this affects the simulation depends on whether the
   corresponding valid property is used by the selected solver and model
   configuration. If it is required, OpenSTREAM may instead use the default
   value, and the simulation may differ from what was intended. If the
   property is not used by the selected solver or active models, the unused
   entry may have no effect on the results.

.. dropdown:: How do I define a steady-state calculation?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   A boundary-condition file containing a single time entry defines a
   steady-state case.

   The solver obtains the steady-state solution through pseudo-time
   advancement. The pseudo-time sequence is a numerical procedure used to
   approach a stationary solution and should not be interpreted as a
   physical transient.

.. dropdown:: How do I define a transient calculation?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Provide boundary-condition values at multiple physical times. Depending
   on the boundary-condition interface, pressure, inlet enthalpy, inlet
   mass flow, power, and axial power distribution can vary with time.

   The solver first calculates the initial steady state. The physical
   transient proceeds only after the initial solution has converged.

   The physical time step is controlled through the numerical options. A
   time-step sensitivity study is recommended when transient timing or peak
   values are important.

.. dropdown:: Why is the mixture solver run before the other solvers?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The two-fluid, three-field, and four-field solvers require a solved
   mixture solution for initialization. They also reuse information from
   the mixture solution, including the pressure-gradient solution.

   A solved mixture solver can be passed explicitly:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      mixSolver = MixtureSolver(inputSet);
      mixSolver.solve();

      twfSolver = TwoFluidSolver(inputSet, mixSolver);
      tfSolver  = ThreeFieldSolver(inputSet, mixSolver);
      ffSolver  = FourFieldSolver(inputSet, mixSolver);

   If a mixture solver is not supplied, the advanced solver constructor
   creates and solves one when required. Passing an existing solved object
   avoids repeating the same mixture calculation.

.. dropdown:: Can I call solve more than once on the same solver object?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   A solver object represents a specific initialized calculation. Calling
   ``solve`` again on an already solved object produces an error stating
   that the solver must be reinitialized.

   For a new calculation, construct a new ``InputSet`` and solver object.
   This keeps each simulation configuration and its stored results clearly
   separated.

.. dropdown:: How do I reduce the amount of information printed in the MATLAB Command Window?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Set ``LOGMODE`` to ``'LOGTOFILEONLY'`` when constructing the
   ``InputSet``:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      inputSet = InputSet( ...
          ...
          LOGMODE = 'LOGTOFILEONLY');

   Solver progress remains available in the session log while most Command
   Window output is suppressed.

Choosing a solver
-----------------

.. dropdown:: Which solver should I use?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The appropriate solver depends on the physical phenomena and level of
   detail required.

   **Mixture solver**
      Use for robust initialization, efficient calculations with mixture
      quantities, hydrodynamically coupled phases, and mixture-based thermal
      non-equilibrium models.

   **Two-fluid solver**
      Use when separate liquid and vapor mass, momentum, and energy behavior
      is needed. The solver can represent different phase velocities,
      enthalpies, and temperatures.

   **Three-field solver**
      Use for annular two-phase flow when the liquid distribution between a
      wall film and entrained droplets is important.

   **Four-field solver**
      Use for annular two-phase flow when the liquid film must be separated
      into base-film and disturbance-wave fields and wave transport is part
      of the analysis.

   Increasing the number of fields does not automatically make a simulation
   more accurate. The selected solver assumptions and closure models must
   be appropriate for the application.

.. dropdown:: What is the difference between a phase and a field?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   A **phase** is a thermodynamic state of matter, such as liquid or vapor.

   A **field** is a computationally resolved constituent with its own
   transported variables or conservation equations. One phase can be
   represented by more than one field. For example:

   * The three-field solver represents the liquid phase through a wall-film
     field and a droplet field.

   * The four-field solver further divides the wall film into a base-film
     field and a disturbance-wave field.

.. dropdown:: Are the three-field and four-field solvers thermal non-equilibrium models?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The current three-field and four-field formulations assume thermal
   equilibrium. Their additional detail concerns the hydrodynamic
   distribution and transport of liquid fields.

   Use the mixture relaxation model or the two-fluid solver when separate
   thermal behavior is required, subject to the assumptions and implemented
   closure models of the selected framework.

.. dropdown:: Where are the three-field and four-field equations applied?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Although the separate annular-flow field equations are numerically solved
   from the channel inlet, their results are physically meaningful only from
   the onset of annular flow. Upstream of this location, the conservation
   equations are formulated so that the annular-flow field variables evolve
   smoothly toward the prescribed conditions at the onset of annular flow.

   Solving the field equations upstream of the onset of annular flow ensures
   that preceding-time-step values are available for all required field
   variables if the onset location moves upstream during a transient
   calculation.

   The onset-of-annular-flow model, the initial film-droplet split, and, for
   the four-field solver, the initial base-film and disturbance-wave split
   can therefore influence the solution near the transition.

.. dropdown:: Why can results near the onset of annular flow be sensitive?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down

   The initial liquid distribution among film, droplets, base film, and
   waves depends on the selected onset and field-splitting models.
   Entrainment and deposition then redistribute liquid as the solution
   develops downstream.

   When the region near annular-flow onset is important, examine
   sensitivity to:

   * the onset-of-annular-flow model;
   * the initial entrained-droplet fraction;
   * the initial base-film and wave split;
   * entrainment and deposition models;
   * spatial resolution.

.. dropdown:: Should entrainment and deposition models be selected together?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Yes. Entrainment and deposition are coupled processes that exchange
   liquid between the film and droplet fields. The corresponding models are
   generally developed and calibrated together to provide a consistent
   representation of this exchange.

   When available, use entrainment and deposition models from the same model
   family unless there is a documented justification for combining models
   from different families.

Numerical convergence
---------------------

.. dropdown:: What is the difference between point convergence and steady-state convergence?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   At each axial node and time step, OpenSTREAM performs local point
   iterations for the nonlinear equations. **Point convergence** refers to
   the change in solved variables between these local iterations.

   For a steady-state calculation, OpenSTREAM also compares solutions
   between successive pseudo-time steps. **Steady-state convergence** refers
   to these temporal changes becoming smaller than the specified
   steady-state criteria.

   A calculation therefore needs adequately converged local iterations and
   an adequately converged pseudo-time solution.

.. dropdown:: What does solveMode='NULL' mean in plotting methods?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The ``NULL`` solve mode displays the pseudo-time history used to obtain
   the initial steady-state solution. It does not represent the physical
   transient.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      solver.plott( ...
          solver.NZ, ...
          'display', {'W','U'}, ...
          'solveMode', 'NULL');

   The default ``REAL`` mode is used to display the stored physical solution.

.. dropdown:: What should I do if the steady-state calculation does not converge?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Start with the information printed by the solver:

   * identify the node with the largest point-iteration count;
   * identify which variable has the largest residual;
   * inspect the final solver state;
   * plot the pseudo-time history with ``solveMode='NULL'``;
   * check model, geometry, and boundary-condition warnings;
   * verify that input values and units are physically reasonable.

   Numerical options that may affect convergence include:

   * maximum point iterations;
   * maximum steady-state pseudo-time iterations;
   * pseudo-time step;
   * variable-specific relaxation factors;
   * pointwise convergence criteria;
   * steady-state convergence criteria.

   Change one numerical setting at a time and document each modification.
   After convergence is achieved, check that the converged solution is not
   excessively sensitive to the selected relaxation factors, iteration limits,
   pseudo-time step, or convergence criteria. Do not obtain apparent
   convergence merely by relaxing the convergence criteria without verifying
   the resulting residuals and physical solution.

.. dropdown:: Why was my transient skipped?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The physical transient is not calculated when the initial steady-state
   solution fails to converge. The solver log indicates that the transient
   is being skipped.

   Inspect the initial pseudo-time solution, correct any input or model
   problems, and obtain a converged initial state before interpreting
   transient results.

.. dropdown:: Can a converged calculation still be inaccurate?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Yes. Numerical convergence indicates that the implemented discrete
   equations have been solved to the selected tolerances. It does not
   establish that:

   * the spatial mesh is sufficiently refined;
   * the physical time step is sufficiently small;
   * the selected closure models are valid for the conditions;
   * the one-dimensional assumptions are appropriate;
   * the model has been validated for the application.

   Mesh sensitivity, time-step sensitivity, conservation checks, and
   comparison with appropriate reference data remain necessary.

.. dropdown:: Is OpenSTREAM limited in terms of mesh size or time-step size?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM does not impose a hard-coded maximum number of axial nodes,
   ``NNODES``, or a predefined set of allowable physical time-step values,
   ``TSTEP``. Within the applicable input requirements, users can select the
   spatial and temporal discretizations appropriate for their calculations.

   The absence of hard-coded limits does not mean that any mesh or time step
   is numerically appropriate. Practical limits arise from available memory,
   computational effort, convergence behavior, numerical accuracy, and the
   spatial and temporal scales of the modeled problem.

   The axial mesh is defined by ``NNODES`` in the physical-model inputs.
   Increasing ``NNODES`` improves the spatial resolution of the
   one-dimensional solution but also increases the number of calculated
   values, memory use, and computational effort.

   A coarse axial mesh may adequately represent smooth distributions but can
   smooth localized variations, shift the predicted location of a
   transition, or fail to capture a local maximum or minimum. Finer meshes
   may be required near:

   * abrupt changes in wall heat flux;

   * local geometric perturbations or pressure losses;

   * boiling or flow-regime transitions;

   * the onset of annular flow;

   * film dryout or regeneration;

   * other regions containing strong axial gradients.

   The physical time step is defined by ``TSTEP`` in the numerical-option
   inputs. OpenSTREAM does not impose a hard-coded minimum or maximum
   physical time-step size. However, ``TSTEP`` must be selected according to
   the duration and shortest relevant time scale of the physical transient.

   OpenSTREAM uses fully implicit backward Euler time integration, which
   provides robust time advancement. Robustness or numerical stability does
   not, however, guarantee temporal accuracy.

   A large physical time step may reproduce the overall transient trend but
   smooth rapid changes, underestimate or miss peak values, or shift the
   calculated timing of an event. A smaller time step provides greater
   temporal resolution but requires more calculated time steps and greater
   computational effort.

   Important prescribed changes in the boundary conditions should also be
   represented with sufficient temporal resolution. A time step that is
   adequate for slowly varying quantities may still be too large for the
   accurate calculation of peak values, peak timing, or short-duration
   behavior.

   The physical time step, ``TSTEP``, should not be confused with the
   steady-state pseudo-time step, ``SSTSTEP``. ``TSTEP`` controls advancement
   of the physical transient, whereas ``SSTSTEP`` controls the numerical
   progression from the solver-assigned initialization state toward the
   steady-state solution.

   A smaller pseudo-time step can make the point iterations easier to
   converge but may require more pseudo-time steps. A larger pseudo-time step
   may accelerate progression toward steady state but can make the local
   nonlinear iterations more difficult or produce less regular convergence.

   Mesh and time-step adequacy should be demonstrated through sensitivity
   studies. Successive spatial or temporal refinements should produce
   progressively smaller changes in the quantities of interest. The finest
   mesh or smallest time step used in a study is a reference solution and
   should not automatically be treated as exact.

.. dropdown:: Can OpenSTREAM use a non-uniform axial mesh?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   No. The current OpenSTREAM implementation uses a uniform axial mesh.

   The user specifies the total channel length, ``LENGTH``, and the number
   of axial nodes, ``NNODES``. OpenSTREAM then distributes the nodes
   uniformly along the channel. The current input interface does not provide
   an option for specifying individual axial-node locations or variable
   node lengths.

   Consequently, local mesh refinement cannot currently be applied only in
   selected regions, such as near:

   * an abrupt change in wall heat flux;

   * a local geometric perturbation or pressure loss;

   * boiling or flow-regime transitions;

   * the onset of annular flow;

   * film dryout or regeneration;

   * another region containing a strong axial gradient.

   When additional spatial resolution is required, ``NNODES`` must be
   increased for the complete channel. This reduces the uniform axial node
   spacing but also increases the number of calculated values and the
   computational effort throughout the domain.

   The absence of a non-uniform mesh option does not necessarily prevent
   accurate calculations. A uniform mesh can be adequate when the axial
   behavior is sufficiently smooth or when enough nodes are used to resolve
   the shortest relevant axial length scale. Mesh adequacy should be
   assessed through a spatial-sensitivity study.

   Support for user-defined axial-node locations or variable node lengths
   may be considered in a future development, but it is not currently
   implemented.
   
.. dropdown:: Which numerical options control steady-state convergence?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Relevant options include the pseudo-time step, the maximum number of
   steady-state iterations, variable-specific relaxation factors, local
   point-iteration tolerances, and steady-state temporal convergence
   criteria.

   The exact property names and defaults are listed in ``Inputs.Options``.
   Use the solver-specific tutorials and package reference when changing
   these values.

Results and post-processing
---------------------------

.. dropdown:: How do I display results?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The solver classes provide plotting methods for common result types.

   ``plotz``
      Plots axial distributions. Multiple physical time indices can produce
      an animated axial plot.

   ``plott``
      Plots time histories at a selected axial location.

   ``plotzt``
      Plots time-elevation distributions where implemented.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      mixSolver.plotz( ...
          'display', {'W','VR'}, ...
          'arrangement', 'horizontal', ...
          'resize', 1);

   Available display names depend on the selected solver. Consult the
   corresponding solver class in the package reference.

.. dropdown:: Can I access results without using the built-in plots?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Yes. Solver objects retain their solution objects and arrays. Examples
   include:

   * mixture variables in ``mixSolver.mixture``;
   * liquid and vapor variables in ``twfSolver.liquid`` and
     ``twfSolver.vapor``;
   * film and droplet variables in ``tfSolver.film`` and ``tfSolver.drop``;
   * base-film and wave variables through the four-field film object.

   The package reference lists the available properties and methods. Check
   property dimensions before processing because arrays may vary over axial
   position, time, and wall index.

.. dropdown:: How do I save a solver object?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Use the solver ``save`` method:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      mixSolver.save( ...
          'name', 'mixSolver', ...
          'showpath', true);

   The solver object contains the imported inputs, solution objects, and
   associated simulation information. Saving it allows later post-processing
   without repeating the calculation.

.. dropdown:: How do I access the base-film and disturbance-wave objects in a four-field solution?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   In the four-field solver, the base-film and disturbance-wave objects are
   contained within the liquid-film object. They are therefore accessed
   through the ``film`` property of the four-field solver:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      base = ffSolver.film.base;
      wave = ffSolver.film.wave;

   For a transient calculation, ``ffSolver.film`` is an array containing one
   film object for each stored physical time step. A specific time step can
   therefore be accessed using its time index:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      tIdx = 1;

      base = ffSolver.film(tIdx).base;
      wave = ffSolver.film(tIdx).wave;

   The base-film and disturbance-wave objects contain their separately
   calculated field quantities. For example:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      baseMassFlow = ffSolver.film(tIdx).base.W;
      baseVelocity = ffSolver.film(tIdx).base.U;

      waveMassFlow = ffSolver.film(tIdx).wave.W;
      waveVelocity = ffSolver.film(tIdx).wave.U;
      waveFrequency = ffSolver.film(tIdx).wave.FREQUENCY;

   The enclosing ``film`` object represents the total liquid film and also
   provides aggregate film quantities derived from the solved base-film and
   disturbance-wave fields. The droplet field is stored separately in
   ``ffSolver.drop``, while the vapor-field solution is retained through the
   mixture solver.

   The base-film and disturbance-wave objects used during the pseudo-time
   calculation of the initial steady state are similarly contained in the
   stored initialization film objects:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      baseInit = ffSolver.filmInit(tIdx).base;
      waveInit = ffSolver.filmInit(tIdx).wave;

.. dropdown:: What is the minimum base film in the four-field solver?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   In the four-field model, disturbance waves pass over a continuous and
   comparatively slow-moving base liquid film. The calculated base-film
   mass flow rate represents the condition immediately after a disturbance
   wave has passed and interacted with the base film.

   Between two successive disturbance waves, the base film evolves without
   direct replenishment from a wave. During this wave-waiting period, wall
   evaporation removes liquid from the base film, while droplet deposition
   can add liquid to it. The **minimum base-film mass flow rate** represents
   the condition reached at the end of this period, immediately before the
   next disturbance wave arrives and replenishes the base film.

   The minimum base-film mass flow rate is therefore a local, periodically
   varying quantity associated with the passage of disturbance waves. It
   should not be interpreted as the minimum value of the calculated
   base-film mass flow rate over the channel or over the complete transient.

   Assuming that the base-film velocity remains constant during the
   wave-waiting period, the corresponding minimum base-film thickness is
   calculated from:

   .. math::

      \delta_{\mathrm{b,min}}
      =
      \frac{W_{\mathrm{b,min}}}
      {\rho_{\mathrm{l,s}}\,u_{\mathrm{b}}\,\Pi}

   where:

   * :math:`\delta_{\mathrm{b,min}}` is the minimum base-film thickness;

   * :math:`W_{\mathrm{b,min}}` is the minimum base-film mass flow rate;

   * :math:`\rho_{\mathrm{l,s}}` is the saturated-liquid density;

   * :math:`u_{\mathrm{b}}` is the base-film velocity;

   * :math:`\Pi` is the corresponding wall perimeter.

   The minimum base film is useful for evaluating intermittent base-film
   depletion between disturbance waves. If the minimum base-film mass flow
   rate or thickness reaches zero, the model predicts that the base film
   becomes locally dry before being reached by the next disturbance wave.
   This is referred to as **intermittent base-film dryout**.

   The minimum base film differs from the equilibrium base film. The
   **equilibrium base-film thickness** is the target condition used by the
   base-film and disturbance-wave mass-exchange model, whereas the
   **minimum base-film thickness** describes the depletion of the base film
   during the interval between successive waves.

.. dropdown:: What does it mean when the calculated liquid-film mass flow rate become negative?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The treatment of negative liquid-film quantities is controlled by the
   ``POSFILM`` physical-model input:

   .. code-block:: text

      POSFILM    ! Positive film flow-rate/thickness model    > TRUE

   ``POSFILM`` is set to ``TRUE`` by default. With this setting, the film
   mass flow rate and film thickness are restricted to non-negative values.

   When ``POSFILM`` is set to ``FALSE``, OpenSTREAM allows the calculated
   film mass flow rate and corresponding film thickness to become negative
   after the film has been completely depleted.

   A negative film mass flow rate is not physically meaningful and does not
   represent liquid flowing in the opposite direction. It is an intentionally
   extended numerical quantity indicating that the integrated film mass
   balance has progressed beyond the predicted dryout condition.

   The liquid-film mass conservation equation accounts for:

   * liquid gain through droplet deposition;

   * liquid loss through film entrainment;

   * liquid loss through wall evaporation.

   When the cumulative film losses exceed the available film inventory, the
   physical film mass flow rate reaches zero and film dryout occurs. With
   ``POSFILM`` set to ``FALSE``, the film mass-balance equation continues to
   be integrated beyond this point, producing a negative value.

   This continuation provides a signed measure of the margin to dryout:

   * a positive film mass flow rate indicates that liquid film remains;

   * a value close to zero indicates proximity to complete film dryout;

   * a negative value indicates that the imposed conditions exceed the
     predicted dryout condition.

   This behavior is useful in critical-power calculations and model-tuning
   studies. For example, power or a closure-model coefficient can be varied
   until the minimum film mass flow rate is sufficiently close to zero. The
   corresponding condition represents the predicted dryout threshold
   according to the selected models.

   Allowing negative values also improves numerical robustness during
   parameter studies and power iterations. A trial calculation can continue
   after exceeding the dryout condition instead of terminating when the film
   first reaches zero.

   Negative film values must be interpreted only as numerical dryout-margin
   indicators. They must not be interpreted as physical post-dryout film
   mass flow rates, negative film thicknesses, or reverse liquid-film flow.
   OpenSTREAM does not use this continuation as a physical post-dryout film
   model.

.. dropdown:: What is the difference between calculated and equilibrium base-film and wave quantities?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   The four-field solver distinguishes between the locally calculated
   base-film thickness and wave frequency and their corresponding
   equilibrium values.

   The **calculated base-film thickness** is obtained from the transported
   base-film mass flow rate, base-film velocity, liquid density, and wall
   perimeter. It represents the current local state of the base-film field
   and may vary with axial position and time.

   The **equilibrium base-film thickness** is obtained from the selected
   equilibrium base-film-thickness model. It represents the base-film
   thickness toward which the local base-film state tends under the current
   flow conditions. It is a closure-model target rather than a separately
   transported field variable.

   The difference between the calculated and equilibrium base-film
   thicknesses is used in the relaxation model governing mass exchange
   between the base-film and disturbance-wave fields. In simplified form,
   the net source driving the base film toward equilibrium is proportional
   to:

   .. math::

      \frac{
      \rho_{\mathrm{l,s}}
      \left(
      \delta_{\mathrm{b,eq}}-\delta_{\mathrm{b}}
      \right)
      }{
      t_{\mathrm{b,relax}}
      }

   where:

   * :math:`\delta_{\mathrm{b}}` is the calculated base-film thickness;

   * :math:`\delta_{\mathrm{b,eq}}` is the equilibrium base-film thickness;

   * :math:`\rho_{\mathrm{l,s}}` is the saturated-liquid density;

   * :math:`t_{\mathrm{b,relax}}` is the base-film relaxation time.

   If the calculated base-film thickness is smaller than its equilibrium
   value, the relaxation term tends to transfer liquid from the disturbance
   waves to the base film. If the calculated base-film thickness is larger
   than its equilibrium value, the relaxation term tends to transfer liquid
   from the base film to the disturbance waves.

   The complete base-film and wave mass balances also include other
   mechanisms, such as droplet deposition, wall evaporation, film
   entrainment, and turbulent mixing. Consequently, the final base-film and
   wave mass-exchange rates are not determined by the thickness-relaxation
   term alone.

   Similarly, the **calculated wave frequency** characterizes the current
   local disturbance-wave field. It is related to the transported wave
   number density and may differ from the frequency corresponding to local
   equilibrium conditions because of wave transport and hydrodynamic
   non-equilibrium.

   The **equilibrium wave frequency** is obtained from the selected
   equilibrium wave-frequency model. It represents the wave frequency toward
   which the local disturbance-wave population tends under the current flow
   conditions.

   The four-field solver transports the wave number density using a
   Boltzmann-type transport equation. Its source term represents the net
   effect of disturbance-wave interactions, including wave creation,
   merging, splitting, and dissipation. Using a relaxation-time
   approximation, the source term is expressed as:

   .. math::

      \Phi_{\mathrm{w}}
      =
      \frac{
      N_{\mathrm{w,eq}}-N_{\mathrm{w}}
      }{
      t_{\mathrm{w,relax}}
      }

   where:

   * :math:`N_{\mathrm{w}}` is the calculated wave number density;

   * :math:`N_{\mathrm{w,eq}}` is the equilibrium wave number density;

   * :math:`t_{\mathrm{w,relax}}` is the wave relaxation time;

   * :math:`\Phi_{\mathrm{w}}` is the net wave-number source or sink rate.

   Wave frequency is often used as a more practical representation of wave
   number density. The corresponding frequency form similarly drives the
   calculated wave frequency toward its equilibrium value.

   If the calculated wave frequency is smaller than its equilibrium value,
   the relaxation source is positive and tends to increase the local wave
   population. If the calculated wave frequency is larger than its
   equilibrium value, the source is negative and tends to reduce the local
   wave population.

   The base-film and wave relaxation processes are related but distinct:

   * the base-film-thickness relaxation controls mass redistribution between
     the base-film and disturbance-wave fields;

   * the wave-frequency relaxation controls the source term in the wave
     number-density transport equation and therefore the evolution of the
     disturbance-wave population.

   The equilibrium quantities should therefore be interpreted as local
   closure-model targets. Differences between calculated and equilibrium
   values are expected in developing or transient annular flow and represent
   the hydrodynamic non-equilibrium modeled by the four-field formulation.

.. dropdown:: What is wave number density, and why is it transported in the four-field solver?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   In the four-field model, disturbance waves are represented as a dispersed
   field of liquid structures moving over the continuous base film. Rather
   than tracking every individual disturbance wave, the model describes the
   wave population using cross-section-averaged macroscopic quantities.

   One of these quantities is the **wave number density**,
   :math:`N_{\mathrm{w}}`. It is the number of disturbance waves per unit
   axial distance and is therefore a spatial measure of the local wave
   population.

   The wave number density is defined as the inverse of the average wave
   spacing:

   .. math::

      N_{\mathrm{w}}
      =
      \frac{1}{\lambda_{\mathrm{w}}}

   where :math:`\lambda_{\mathrm{w}}` is the average axial distance between
   two successive disturbance waves.

   Wave spacing is related to the wave velocity and wave frequency by:

   .. math::

      \lambda_{\mathrm{w}}
      =
      \frac{u_{\mathrm{w}}}{f_{\mathrm{w}}}

   Consequently:

   .. math::

      N_{\mathrm{w}}
      =
      \frac{f_{\mathrm{w}}}{u_{\mathrm{w}}}

   where :math:`u_{\mathrm{w}}` is the disturbance-wave velocity and
   :math:`f_{\mathrm{w}}` is the frequency at which disturbance waves pass a
   fixed axial location.

   Wave number density and wave frequency describe related but different
   quantities. Wave number density describes how many waves are present per
   unit axial distance, whereas wave frequency describes how many waves pass
   a fixed location per unit time. Their relationship therefore depends on
   the wave velocity.

   The four-field solver does not assume that the local wave population is
   always equal to its equilibrium value. Instead, it transports the wave
   number density using a one-dimensional wave number-density transport
   equation.

   This equation is based on the concept of a Boltzmann transport equation
   applied to the number density of dispersed fluid particles. In the
   four-field model, disturbance waves are treated as the dispersed fluid
   structures. The equation is integrated over the possible wave sizes, so
   it transports the total wave number density rather than tracking separate
   populations for each wave size.

   The transport equation can be written as:

   .. math::

      \frac{\partial N_{\mathrm{w}}}{\partial t}
      +
      \frac{\partial
      \left(
      u_{\mathrm{w}} N_{\mathrm{w}}
      \right)}
      {\partial z}
      =
      \Phi_{\mathrm{w}}

   The left-hand side represents:

   * the local temporal change in wave number density; and

   * the axial transport of waves at the disturbance-wave velocity.

   The right-hand side, :math:`\Phi_{\mathrm{w}}`, represents the net source
   or sink of disturbance waves caused by interactions such as wave
   formation, merging, splitting, and dissipation.

   In the current model, these interactions are represented using a
   relaxation-time approximation:

   .. math::

      \Phi_{\mathrm{w}}
      =
      \frac{
      N_{\mathrm{w,eq}}-N_{\mathrm{w}}
      }{
      t_{\mathrm{w,relax}}
      }

   where:

   * :math:`N_{\mathrm{w}}` is the calculated wave number density;

   * :math:`N_{\mathrm{w,eq}}` is the equilibrium wave number density
     obtained from the selected closure model;

   * :math:`t_{\mathrm{w,relax}}` is the wave relaxation time.

   If the calculated wave number density is smaller than its equilibrium
   value, the source term is positive and increases the local wave
   population. This represents a net effect of processes that create or
   split waves.

   If the calculated wave number density is larger than its equilibrium
   value, the source term is negative and decreases the local wave
   population. This represents a net effect of processes such as wave
   merging or dissipation.

   The transport equation allows the disturbance-wave population to respond
   progressively to changing flow conditions instead of changing
   instantaneously to its local equilibrium value. It therefore represents
   hydrodynamic non-equilibrium associated with developing annular flow,
   phase change, inlet effects, geometric perturbations, and transient
   conditions.

   Wave frequency is generally more convenient for interpretation and
   comparison with measurements. OpenSTREAM therefore commonly expresses
   and plots the transported wave population in terms of calculated and
   equilibrium wave frequencies. However, the underlying physical concept
   remains the transport of the spatial wave population represented by the
   wave number density.

   The wave number-density transport equation is separate from the wave mass
   and momentum conservation equations:

   * the wave mass equation determines how much liquid mass is carried by
     the disturbance-wave field;

   * the wave momentum equation determines the disturbance-wave velocity;

   * the wave number-density transport equation determines how the number of
     disturbance waves evolves.

   Together with the wave shape model, these quantities are used to
   characterize wave spacing, width, amplitude, and other properties of the
   disturbance-wave field.

   field-specific results to the annular-flow region. This is appropriate
   because separate film, droplet, base-film, and wave equations apply from
   the onset of annular flow.

   Where supported, set the ``annular`` plotting option to ``false`` to
   inspect initialization outside that region:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      solver.plotz( ...
          'display', 'W', ...
          'annular', false);

   Interpret pre-annular field values as initialization quantities rather
   than as a complete pre-annular multi-field model.

.. dropdown:: How do I plot only part of the channel or selected times?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   By default, ``plotz`` includes all axial elevations and all stored
   physical time steps. Similarly, ``plott`` includes all stored physical
   time steps at the selected axial location.

   The plotting methods also allow selected axial and time indices to be
   specified. The same general syntax is used by all OpenSTREAM solvers.

   To plot only part of the channel, first identify the corresponding axial
   indices and pass them using ``zIdx``. For example, the following code
   plots results between elevations of 1 and 4 m:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      zIdx = find(solver.Z >= 1 & solver.Z <= 4);

      solver.plotz( ...
          'display', {'W','U'}, ...
          'zIdx', zIdx, ...
          'arrangement', 'horizontal', ...
          'resize', 1);

   For a transient calculation, the first positional argument of ``plotz``
   selects one or more stored time indices. For example, the following code
   plots the first, middle, and final stored states over the selected axial
   range:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      tIdx = unique([1, round(solver.NTIME/2), solver.NTIME]);
      zIdx = find(solver.Z >= 1 & solver.Z <= 4);

      solver.plotz( ...
          tIdx, ...
          'display', {'W','U'}, ...
          'zIdx', zIdx, ...
          'arrangement', 'horizontal', ...
          'resize', 1);

   When several time indices are selected, ``plotz`` generates an animated
   axial plot containing the selected states.

   To plot a time history at one axial location, pass the axial index as the
   first argument of ``plott`` and select the stored time indices using
   ``tIdx``. For example, the following code plots only the first half of
   the transient at the axial node closest to 3.5 m:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      zTarget = 3.5;
      [~, zIdx] = min(abs(solver.Z - zTarget));

      tIdx = 1:ceil(solver.NTIME/2);

      solver.plott( ...
          zIdx, ...
          'display', {'W','U'}, ...
          'tIdx', tIdx, ...
          'arrangement', 'horizontal', ...
          'resize', 1);

   The same index-selection approach applies to the mixture, two-fluid,
   three-field, and four-field solvers. However, the available ``display`` values
   depend on the selected solver because each solver stores different
   physical quantities.

.. dropdown:: How do I compare several model configurations?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Create one ``InputSet`` and solver object per model ID, store each object
   separately, and extract the same comparison quantities from every case.

   Use distinct session directories to avoid overwriting results. A compact
   MATLAB table is useful for comparing scalar metrics, while solver objects
   can be retained separately for detailed post-processing.

Physical scope and limitations
------------------------------

.. dropdown:: What are the main simplifications in OpenSTREAM, and why are they considered reasonable?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM uses several deliberate simplifications to provide a
   transparent, computationally efficient, and numerically robust environment
   for developing and evaluating one-dimensional two-phase flow models.
   These simplifications define the intended scope of the code and must be
   considered when interpreting its results.

   The main simplifications are:

   * **One-dimensional, cross-section-averaged flow.** Flow variables vary
     only along the channel axis. Radial, azimuthal, and other local
     distributions are not resolved explicitly and must instead be
     represented through averaged quantities and closure models.

     This approximation is reasonable for straight channels when axial
     transport dominates and detailed multidimensional effects, such as
     crossflow, flow separation, or strongly asymmetric mixing, are not
     essential to the quantity being studied. It also makes OpenSTREAM
     suitable for rapid model development, sensitivity studies, and
     comparison of closure models.

   * **Straight channels with constant cross-sectional area.** The current
     geometry represents a straight flow path with constant flow area.
     Multiple wall perimeters and non-uniform wall heating can be defined,
     and local perturbations can be represented through dedicated models,
     but continuous geometric variation is not resolved.

     This approximation covers many experimental channels and idealized
     thermal-hydraulic problems, including tubes, annuli, rectangular
     channels, and simplified small rod-bundle representations. It enables
     investigation of axial two-phase flow behavior without introducing
     additional geometric effects.

   * **Mixture-based pressure-gradient solution.** The pressure-gradient
     solution obtained from the mixture solver is reused by the two-fluid,
     three-field, and four-field solvers rather than independently solving a
     fully coupled pressure-velocity system in each framework.

     This treatment significantly improves numerical stability and provides
     a consistent pressure field for comparisons among the solver
     frameworks. It introduces some inconsistency between the pressure
     solution and the separate field momentum equations, but the available
     OpenSTREAM publications report that this inconsistency is negligible
     for many applications. Its acceptability must nevertheless be assessed
     for each new application.

   * **Fluid properties evaluated at the system pressure.** Fluid
     thermophysical properties are currently evaluated using the prescribed
     system pressure rather than the calculated local pressure along the
     channel.

     Consequently, an axial pressure decrease does not modify the local
     saturation properties and cannot, by itself, produce flashing.
     OpenSTREAM therefore does not currently represent flashing caused by
     local pressure drop along the channel.

     Time-dependent changes in the prescribed system pressure are included
     in the fluid-property evaluation. OpenSTREAM can therefore represent
     flashing caused by a decrease in system pressure, subject to the
     assumptions and capabilities of the selected thermal non-equilibrium
     and phase-change models.

     This simplification is considered reasonable for the high-pressure,
     relatively short channel applications targeted by the current
     OpenSTREAM frameworks, when the axial pressure variation is small
     relative to the system pressure. Under these conditions, the resulting
     variation in saturation properties along the channel is generally
     expected to be limited.

     The approximation must be reassessed when the channel pressure drop is
     sufficiently large to affect the local saturation temperature,
     saturation enthalpies, phase densities, or phase-change behavior. It is
     not appropriate when pressure-drop-induced flashing is an important
     part of the physical problem.

   * **Neglect of surface-tension forces in the conservation equations.**
     Surface tension may be used in closure quantities, but explicit
     surface-tension force contributions are neglected in the governing
     momentum equations.

     This simplification is considered reasonable for the high-pressure
     channel-flow conditions targeted by the current implementations, where
     the retained pressure, inertia, gravity, and wall and interfacial
     momentum-transfer terms are generally more important at the
     one-dimensional field scale. It may not be appropriate for
     capillary-dominated flows, very small channels, or problems controlled
     by interface curvature.

   * **Neglect of heating caused by friction.** Mechanical energy dissipated
     by wall or interfacial friction is not added explicitly to the fluid
     energy equations.

     This contribution is considered small relative to the imposed wall
     heating and phase-change energy transfer for the high-pressure boiling
     applications for which the current models were developed. It should not
     be neglected without assessment in applications involving exceptionally
     large pressure losses or little external heating.

   * **Neglect of temporal pressure-gradient contributions.** The current
     formulations omit minor energy or momentum contributions associated
     with the temporal pressure gradient.

     This approximation is considered reasonable for the operational
     transients targeted by the current high-pressure boiling
     applications. It is not appropriate for rapid pressure-wave,
     depressurization, water-hammer, choking, or shock-wave problems, which
     are currently outside the intended scope of OpenSTREAM.

   * **Neglect of spatial gradients of saturated-fluid enthalpies.** Spatial
     changes in saturated liquid and vapor enthalpies associated with the
     pressure distribution are neglected in the simplified conservation
     equations.

     This approximation is considered reasonable for the high-pressure
     conditions and operational transients targeted by the current
     OpenSTREAM frameworks. Its adequacy should be reconsidered for cases
     with large pressure variations or strong depressurization.

   * **Simplified flow-regime and interfacial-topology transitions.** The
     current two-fluid solver uses simplified assumptions to identify flow
     regimes and select the corresponding closure models.

     This approach provides a practical framework for implementing and
     testing separate-phase conservation equations, but it limits the
     physical realism of complex transients involving repeated or strongly
     evolving changes in interfacial topology. The two-fluid results should
     therefore be interpreted according to the maturity and validation range
     of the selected transition and closure models.

   * **Thermal equilibrium in the three-field and four-field solvers.** The
     film, droplet, base-film, disturbance-wave, and vapor fields are assumed
     to share the applicable saturation thermodynamic state. The solvers
     resolve hydrodynamic non-equilibrium among the fields but do not solve
     separate field energy equations for thermal non-equilibrium.

     This approximation is reasonable for saturated annular-flow studies in
     which liquid-field mass and momentum transport, entrainment,
     deposition, film depletion, and disturbance-wave behavior are the
     primary phenomena of interest. It is not appropriate when separate
     field temperatures (e.g., post-dryout thermal non-equilibrium) are essential.

   * **First-order numerical discretization.** The conservation equations
     are solved using first-order upwind spatial discretization and fully
     implicit backward Euler time integration. Nonlinear source terms and
     field couplings are treated through fixed-point iterations.

     These methods are comparatively simple and numerically robust, which is
     useful for an open model-development platform and for obtaining
     steady-state solutions through pseudo-time advancement. Their numerical
     diffusion and first-order accuracy make mesh- and time-step-sensitivity
     studies necessary when spatial gradients, transient timing, or peak
     values are important.

   These simplifications are reasonable only within the intended application
   domain and for quantities that are not controlled by the neglected
   phenomena. They make the governing equations easier to understand,
   modify, test, and compare while reducing computational cost and improving
   numerical robustness.

   A simplification must not be interpreted as universally negligible.
   Before using OpenSTREAM for a new fluid, geometry, flow regime, or
   transient, assess whether the neglected terms and unresolved phenomena
   could materially affect the quantities of interest. Numerical
   convergence, sensitivity studies, conservation checks, and comparison
   with suitable reference data remain necessary.

.. dropdown:: What are the current practical and technical limitations of OpenSTREAM?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM is under active development. The current implementation is
   intended for one-dimensional, thermally expandable, single-component,
   liquid-vapor boiling flows in straight channels. The thermally expandable
   formulation accounts for changes in fluid properties with the local
   thermodynamic state, but it is not a general compressible-flow
   formulation.

   The principal current limitations include:

   * **No general compressible-flow or pressure-wave formulation.**
     OpenSTREAM accounts for thermodynamic density changes associated with
     heating, cooling, system pressure variation, and phase change. This
     thermally expandable treatment is suitable for the intended boiling-flow
     applications, but it is not a fully compressible-flow formulation.

     In particular, the current implementation is not intended to resolve
     acoustic-wave propagation, rapid pressure waves, shock waves, expansion
     waves, choked flow, water hammer, or other phenomena for which
     compressible pressure-wave dynamics are essential.

   * **No wall condensation model.** OpenSTREAM can represent interfacial
     condensation within the fluid, where supported by the selected solver
     and closure models, but it does not currently calculate condensation
     caused by heat transfer to a cooled wall.

   * **No counter-current flow.** The current solution algorithms and
     boundary-condition treatment are intended for co-current flow in a
     single axial direction.

   In addition, OpenSTREAM does not currently support:

   * multi-component fluid mixtures;
   * non-condensable gases;
   * solid-particle flows, including liquid-solid, gas-solid, and
     liquid-gas-solid flows;
   * pressure-drop-induced flashing. Fluid properties are evaluated at the
     prescribed system pressure rather than the calculated local pressure;
   * wall heat conduction or conjugate heat transfer;
   * continuously varying channel area;
   * bends, junctions, plena, or connected flow networks;
   * crossflow between neighboring channels;
   * multidimensional flow resolution;
   * general-purpose component models such as pumps, valves, tanks, or heat exchangers;
   * thermal non-equilibrium in the three-field and four-field solvers;
   * fully coupled pressure-velocity solution in the advanced solvers;

   Some currently unsupported capabilities may be considered for future development.

.. dropdown:: Is OpenSTREAM a CFD code?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   No. OpenSTREAM is not a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code in the
   conventional engineering sense.

   OpenSTREAM solves one-dimensional, cross-section-averaged conservation
   equations for steady-state and transient two-phase flows. Depending on
   the selected solver, these equations describe mixture, phase, or field
   mass, momentum, and energy transport. Physical processes that are not
   resolved explicitly are represented through closure models.

   In contrast, a conventional CFD code discretizes a multidimensional
   computational domain and resolves spatial variations of the flow within
   that domain. OpenSTREAM does not resolve radial, azimuthal, or other
   multidimensional distributions of velocity, pressure, temperature, void
   fraction, or phase structure.

   OpenSTREAM also does not explicitly resolve:

   * local velocity and temperature profiles across the channel;

   * multidimensional turbulence structures;

   * flow separation, recirculation, or secondary flow;

   * circumferential transport around the channel;

   * crossflow between neighboring channels;

   * detailed three-dimensional geometrical effects.

   Instead, OpenSTREAM uses cross-section-averaged quantities and closure
   models for wall friction, interfacial transfer, phase change,
   entrainment, deposition, and other unresolved processes.

   This one-dimensional formulation is intentional. OpenSTREAM was
   developed to support the formulation, implementation, assessment, and
   validation of the types of one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic models used
   in established system codes and subchannel-analysis codes. Its purpose is
   to provide an open and transparent environment in which these models can
   be inspected, modified, compared, and extended.

   The one-dimensional approach also provides a computationally efficient
   environment for model development, sensitivity studies, and validation.
   It is particularly suitable for straight-channel problems in which axial
   transport is the principal behavior of interest and multidimensional
   effects are not essential to the quantities being studied.

   OpenSTREAM should therefore be described as a **one-dimensional,
   multi-field, two-phase flow simulation environment**, rather than as a
   CFD code.

.. dropdown:: Can OpenSTREAM simulate flashing caused by a pressure decrease?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM can represent flashing caused by a time-dependent decrease in
   the prescribed system pressure, subject to the assumptions and
   capabilities of the selected phase-change model.

   However, OpenSTREAM does not currently represent flashing caused by the
   calculated local pressure drop along the channel. Fluid thermophysical
   properties, including saturation properties, are evaluated using the
   prescribed system pressure rather than the calculated local pressure.
   Therefore, the axial pressure decrease does not locally modify the
   saturation state used by the fluid-property calculations.

   This approximation is considered reasonable for the high-pressure,
   relatively short channel applications targeted by the current
   OpenSTREAM frameworks when the axial pressure variation is small relative
   to the system pressure. Under these conditions, the corresponding axial
   variation in saturation properties is expected to remain limited.

   The approximation is not suitable when pressure-drop-induced flashing or
   axial variations in saturation properties are important to the physical
   problem.

.. dropdown:: What geometries can OpenSTREAM represent?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM represents one-dimensional flow in straight channels.
   Cross-sectional geometry is described through averaged quantities such
   as flow area and wall perimeter.

   The formulation supports multi-wall channel representations, allowing
   different wall surfaces and heating distributions to be considered.
   Examples may include tubes, annuli, rectangular channels, and simplified
   small rod-bundle representations when the one-dimensional approximation
   is appropriate.

   OpenSTREAM does not resolve bends, crossflow, or detailed
   three-dimensional velocity and temperature distributions.

.. dropdown:: How are multi-wall geometries represented in OpenSTREAM?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM represents a multi-wall geometry as a single one-dimensional
   flow channel bounded by two or more wall surfaces. The channel has one
   common cross-sectional flow area, while the perimeter of each wall is
   specified separately using the ``PERIM`` geometry input.

   For example, an annular channel can be represented by defining separate
   perimeters for the inner and outer walls. Other idealized configurations,
   such as rectangular channels or simplified subchannels, can be represented
   in the same way when the one-dimensional approximation is appropriate.

   A simplified annular-channel geometry could, for example, use:

   .. code-block:: text

      ID       ! Geometry identifier                    > ANNULUS
      LENGTH   ! Channel length [m]                     > ...
      AREA     ! Common cross-sectional flow area [m2] > ...
      PERIM    ! Inner and outer wall perimeters [m]   > ... ...
      END

   The number of walls is determined automatically from the number of
   perimeter values specified in ``PERIM``. OpenSTREAM also calculates the
   contribution of each wall to the total channel perimeter.

   When several walls are present, the boundary-condition power
   distribution must be consistent with the number of wall perimeters.
   Wall-specific results can be inspected using the wall-selection options
   provided by the applicable solver plotting methods. 

   Wall-dependent quantities are stored separately for each wall where
   supported by the selected solver. These quantities may include:

   * imposed wall heat flux;
   * liquid-film mass flow rate and velocity;
   * film thickness;
   * wall boiling or film evaporation;
   * wall shear stress;
   * film entrainment and droplet deposition;
   * base-film and disturbance-wave quantities in the four-field solver.

   This wall-level formulation allows different walls to have different
   heating conditions. Heated and unheated walls, or walls with different
   power distributions, can therefore be represented within the same
   one-dimensional channel.

   The bulk or core flow remains shared by all walls. Depending on the
   selected solver, this includes mixture quantities, vapor quantities, and
   the pressure distribution. Wall-specific fields interact through this
   common bulk-flow solution and the implemented closure models.

   Multi-wall treatment does not create separate connected flow channels.
   OpenSTREAM does not currently calculate crossflow between neighboring
   channels, independent flow redistribution among parallel channels, or
   multidimensional transport around the channel cross-section. These
   configurations require a different system or subchannel representation.

.. dropdown:: Can the wall-specific solutions interact with one another?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Yes, but only indirectly through the common bulk-flow solution.

   In a multi-wall geometry, OpenSTREAM represents all walls as bounding
   surfaces of the same one-dimensional flow channel. Each wall can have
   its own perimeter, heating conditions, and wall-specific quantities. In
   the three-field and four-field solvers, the liquid-film equations are
   formulated separately for each wall. The four-field solver similarly
   calculates separate base-film and disturbance-wave quantities for each
   wall.

   The wall-specific fields do not exchange liquid directly with one
   another. For example, there is no model that transfers liquid laterally
   from the film on one wall directly to the film on another wall.

   However, the wall solutions are coupled indirectly through the shared
   mixture, vapor, and droplet fields. A wall can therefore influence the
   other walls through mechanisms such as:

   * wall heating and evaporation, which affect the common vapor and
     mixture solution;

   * film entrainment, which transfers liquid from a wall film to the common
     entrained-droplet field;

   * droplet deposition, which redistributes liquid from the common droplet
     field back to the wall films;

   * wall and interfacial momentum exchanges, which contribute to the common
     flow solution;

   Consequently, changing the heat flux or film behavior on one wall can
   affect the bulk-flow conditions and thereby modify the conditions
   experienced by the other walls. This is an indirect interaction through
   the shared flow, rather than a direct exchange between neighboring wall
   fields. The multi-wall formulation is specifically intended to represent
   straight channels with multiple independent wall surfaces and potentially
   different heating rates.

   In the three-field and four-field formulations, entrainment and
   deposition provide an important indirect coupling mechanism. Liquid
   entrained from one wall enters the common droplet population and may
   subsequently deposit on another wall, depending on the implemented
   deposition-partition model. The wall equations themselves nevertheless
   remain wall-specific. The four-field equations additionally include
   direct exchanges between the base-film and disturbance-wave fields on
   the same wall, but these are not exchanges between different walls.

   This treatment does not resolve circumferential transport, lateral
   liquid-film flow, or multidimensional mixing between walls. OpenSTREAM
   also does not represent separate neighboring channels or crossflow
   between them. When these effects are important, a multidimensional or
   subchannel formulation is required.

.. dropdown:: What units should I use?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM uses SI units unless a specific model or input explicitly
   states otherwise. Common units include:

   * length in metres;
   * time in seconds;
   * pressure in pascals;
   * temperature in kelvin;
   * mass flow rate in kilograms per second;
   * velocity in metres per second;
   * specific enthalpy in joules per kilogram;
   * wall heat flux in watts per square metre.

   Check comments in the example input files and the relevant property
   documentation before entering a value.

.. dropdown:: Can OpenSTREAM be used for safety or licensing analysis?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   No. **OpenSTREAM must not be used for safety or licensing analysis.**

   OpenSTREAM is intended for research, education, model development,
   performance evaluation, and validation activities. It is not a licensed
   safety-analysis code and has not been qualified for use in regulatory or
   licensing applications.
 
   Results produced with OpenSTREAM must not be used as the basis for safety
   decisions, licensing submissions, regulatory compliance demonstrations,
   or the operation of safety-related systems.

.. dropdown:: Which fluids can be simulated with OpenSTREAM?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   OpenSTREAM is designed for single-component, liquid-vapor fluids whose
   required thermophysical properties are available through CoolProp. The
   fluid is selected using its CoolProp identifier in the ``FLUID`` model
   input.

   The CoolProp interface can be tested in MATLAB before constructing a
   complete simulation:

   .. code-block:: matlab

      cp = CoolPropWrapper.CoolPropWrapper('WATER');

   CoolProp compatibility alone does not demonstrate that an OpenSTREAM
   calculation is physically applicable or validated. The selected closure
   models must also be appropriate for the fluid and operating conditions.
   Many current models and example cases have been developed or evaluated
   primarily for boiling water and steam.

   OpenSTREAM does not currently support multi-component fluid mixtures or
   non-condensable gases. Pseudo-pure fluids, predefined mixtures, and
   incompressible solutions available in CoolProp must not be assumed to be
   compatible without verification of the full property and model
   requirements.

.. dropdown:: How are fluid properties calculated?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Fluid properties are calculated using CoolProp through
   CoolPropWrapper. The fluid is selected using the ``FLUID`` model input,
   while the ``PROPERTIES`` model input defines how the phase properties
   are evaluated.

   Two fluid-property options are available:

   * ``SATURATED``: Phase properties are evaluated at saturated conditions
     using the prescribed system pressure. Saturated liquid properties are
     used for the liquid phase, and saturated vapor properties are used for
     the vapor phase. The properties therefore do not vary with the local
     phase enthalpy.

   * ``PSYSTEM``: Phase properties are evaluated using the prescribed
     system pressure and the local phase enthalpy. This allows liquid
     properties to vary between subcooled and saturated-liquid conditions
     and vapor properties to vary between saturated-vapor and superheated
     conditions.

   ``SATURATED`` is the default option and provides a simple property
   treatment that is appropriate when variations within the subcooled
   liquid and superheated vapor regions are not important. ``PSYSTEM`` is
   more appropriate when thermal non-equilibrium causes the liquid or vapor
   enthalpy to differ significantly from its saturation value.

   The option is selected in the physical-model input file. For example:

   .. code-block:: text

      FLUID        ! CoolProp fluid identifier       > WATER
      PROPERTIES   ! Fluid property assumptions      > PSYSTEM

   For both options, the saturation temperature, saturated liquid and vapor
   enthalpies, latent heat, saturated phase densities, and other saturation
   properties are calculated at the prescribed system pressure.

   The current implementation does not evaluate properties using the
   calculated local pressure along the channel. Consequently, selecting
   ``PSYSTEM`` accounts for variations with local phase enthalpy, but it
   does not enable flashing caused by the local axial pressure drop.

.. dropdown:: Does a more detailed solver always give a better result?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   No. Greater field resolution introduces additional equations, closure
   models, numerical parameters, and applicability limits. A more detailed
   solver is useful only when its modeled phenomena and validation basis
   match the application.

   Select the simplest solver that represents the required physics and
   document the sensitivity to influential assumptions.

.. dropdown:: What should I verify before trusting a result?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   At minimum, check:

   * input values, IDs, units, and warnings;
   * point and steady-state convergence;
   * mass and energy consistency;
   * spatial-mesh sensitivity;
   * physical time-step sensitivity for transients;
   * sensitivity to influential closure models;
   * applicability and validation of the selected models.

Extending and contributing
--------------------------

.. dropdown:: How do I select another closure model?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Closure models are selected in the physical-model input file. Valid
   values are defined by classes in the ``InputEnums`` package.

   Model selections may control, for example:

   * void fraction;
   * wall friction;
   * interfacial heat transfer;
   * phase or field momentum;
   * entrainment and deposition;
   * onset of annular flow;
   * base-film thickness;
   * disturbance-wave frequency.

   Consult the relevant ``InputEnums`` class and ``Inputs.Model`` property
   before adding an entry. If a selection is not explicitly provided, the
   documented default is used.

.. dropdown:: How do I add a new closure model?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Adding a closure model normally requires coordinated changes to:

   #. the relevant ``InputEnums`` class;
   #. any new model properties and defaults in ``Inputs.Model``;
   #. the solver or field method that evaluates the closure;
   #. model documentation and references;
   #. input examples;
   #. verification and regression tests.

   The implementation should document equations, units, assumptions,
   validity range, and source references. Verify the closure independently
   before using it in validation or engineering analysis.

   Use the OpenSTREAM GitHub issue tracker. Before opening an issue:

   * search for an existing report;
   * provide the OpenSTREAM revision;
   * provide the MATLAB, Python, and CoolProp versions;
   * include the smallest input case that reproduces the problem;
   * include the complete error message and stack trace;
   * distinguish unexpected code behavior from a model-validity question.

   Issue tracker:

   * https://github.com/OpenSTREAM-solvers/openstream/issues

.. dropdown:: How can I request a feature?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Open a GitHub issue describing:

   * the use case and physical or workflow need;
   * the proposed behavior;
   * which solver or package is affected;
   * any relevant equations, references, or examples;
   * how the feature could be verified.

   Search existing issues first to avoid duplicating an active request.

   Fork the repository, create a focused branch, implement and test the
   change, and submit a pull request. Follow the coding, testing,
   documentation, and code-of-conduct guidance in the Community section.

   Keep changes focused and include documentation and tests when behavior or
   interfaces change.

.. dropdown:: How do I contribute to the documentation?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Edit the reStructuredText source files, build the documentation locally
   when possible, and verify both HTML and PDF outputs. Add or update links,
   references, examples, and package documentation as needed.

.. dropdown:: Where can I get additional help?
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :chevron: right-down

   Consult, in this order:

   #. the Quick Start and solver-specific tutorials;
   #. the theory overview;
   #. the glossary and notation guide;
   #. the package reference;
   #. existing GitHub issues;
   #. the GitHub issue tracker for a new question or reproducible problem.

   When requesting help, include enough information for another user to
   reproduce the calculation.
